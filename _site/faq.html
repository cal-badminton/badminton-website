            <h2>Where can I play?</h2>
            <p>We would love to see you come and play with us at the RSF Fieldhouse. There are also other professional badminton gyms in the Bay Area, such as EBA, BBC, Bintang, CBA, just to name a few.</p>

          </li>
        
      
        
          <li class="wrapper style2">
            <h2>When do club members show up?</h2>
            <p>Open gyms are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and practices are on Saturdays from 10am-1pm, all at the RSF Fieldhouse.</p>

          </li>
        
      
        
          <li class="wrapper style1">
            <h2>Does the club cover RSF membership?</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, no. Because we use the RSF facilities for practices, meets, and our tournament, all members need to obtain RSF membership separately. For more information, you can visit RSF’s membership page.</p>

          </li>
        
      
        
          <li class="wrapper style2">
            <h2>How do I join the club?</h2>
            <p>Join our Slack and Facebook group for this semester’s information and be sure to fill out the required forms.</p>

          </li>
        
      
        
          <li class="wrapper style1">
            <h2>Why does the gym schedule sometimes change?</h2>
            <p>The RSF has to juggle a lot of activities in its facilities. The schedule is fairly constant, but is sometimes thrown off by special events, such as tournaments for volleyball, basketball, or other sports. To keep yourself up to date, please refer to RSF’s master calendar.</p>

          </li>
        
      
        
          <li class="wrapper style2">
            <h2>Why are there sometimes only 3 available courts to play on?</h2>
            <p>The RSF workers are the ones that set up the badminton nets. Depending on the RSF gym schedule, occasionally badminton is only scheduled to have 3 courts for certain times. Because so few people usually show up at the very beginning of open gym, the RSF workers only set up 3 courts until more people show up and leave the other half for basketball. If there are only 3 courts set up and people are waiting for courts, go down to the front desk (just inside the main entrance) and ask to check the schedule. If badminton is supposed to have both sides of the gym, ask them to set up the other side.</p>

          </li>
        
      
        
          <li class="wrapper style1">
            <h2>What does 'club only' mean?</h2>
            <p>The Fieldhouse is open on Saturdays from 10am to 1pm for “club only” practice. This is the time when ladder matches and drilling happens for the club. We almost never take up the full 6 courts, so others are welcome to use any free courts. But this is also the time that intercollegiate meets takes place, so the club reserves the right to remove non-club members if it needs the court space.</p>

          </li>
        
      
        
          <li class="wrapper style2">
            <h2>Is there a club fee?</h2>
            <p>Dues are $85 and cover playing/training at the RSF, free birds, school meets, and socials. Even if you complete all the other steps to join the club, you will not be able to join unless you pay dues. This helps us run the club efficiently and be able to have a lot of fun events.</p>

          </li>
        
      
        
          <li class="wrapper style1">
            <h2>Why should I join?</h2>
            <p>There are many, many reasons to join, some of which are listed on the welcome page. Some of the more compelling reasons are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>1. Meet people who love doing what you love doing! </li>
  <li>2. The club can be competitive, social, or both. </li>
  <li>3. The club pays for the cost of most socials. </li>
  <li>4. You won't have to buy your own birds anymore. </li>
  <li>5. It's fun, fun, fun! </li>
</ol>

          </li>
        
      
        
          <li class="wrapper style2">
            <h2>Who can join?</h2>
            <p>Cal Badminton is open to registered UC Berkeley students (either undergraduate or graduate). While there are certain restrictions on who can play in intercollegiate meets, EVERYONE has access to club practices, tournaments and socials. <strong>You do not need to be good to join.</strong> There is time on Saturdays for drilling and practicing and we would be happy to help you.</p>
