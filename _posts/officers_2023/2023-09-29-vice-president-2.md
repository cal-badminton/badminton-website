bio: "Hello everyone! My name is Rosemary and I'm a 3rd year studying computer science and data science. In addition to badminton, I enjoy singing, reading, eating, and hanging out with people. A fun (yet sad) fact about me is that I have a very low spice tolerance :'( Feel free to reach out and talk to me about anything, can't wait to meet everyone!"
