title: "External Vice President"
bio: "I’m no longer a coffee and boba addict, but if you ask, I’m usually always down. I also love being active by doing weights, core, and hiking. I’m currently in my 20’s, learning how to ride a bike. I’m having a hard time going straight, but I like the feeling of an adrenaline rush."
