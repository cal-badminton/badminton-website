title: "Webmaster"
bio: "Hi there! Besides badminton, I enjoy playing piano covers of popular songs, playing video games (add me on Riot / Steam / Blizzard :D), and chill talks with friends. You can catch me at open gyms (when they are back T_T) or near the west side of Berkeley. I'm looking forward to meeting everyone this year! <3"
