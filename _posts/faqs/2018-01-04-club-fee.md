title: "Is there a club fee?"
---

Yes. Club dues are $70/semester during the school year and $35 for the summer. The club uses membership fees to cover birds ($$$), social events, and tournament operating costs. By coming to practice regularly and attending a few events, you can easily get more than your money's worth from the club.
