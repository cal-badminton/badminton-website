title: "Is there a club fee?"
---

We have implemented a two-tier dues system for this 2021 fall semester. You must pay dues in order to be able to come to retreat, buy uniforms, and attend end-of-the-semester banquet. Even if you complete all the other steps to join the club, you will not be able to join unless you pay dues. This helps us run the club efficiently and be able to have a lot of fun events. 

<!-- Yes. Club dues are $70/semester during the school year and $35 for the summer. The club uses membership fees to cover birds ($$$), social events, and tournament operating costs. By coming to practice regularly and attending a few events, you can easily get more than your money's worth from the club. -->
