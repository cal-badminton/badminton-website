title: "When do club members show up?"
---

Club members usually play Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. Only occasionally do club members show up on Friday nights. A few members come as early as 5:30pm on Tues. and Thurs. and most members will have left by 9:00pm. Members come between 10:00am and 1:00pm on Saturdays. You can find us on the right side of the Fieldhouse.
