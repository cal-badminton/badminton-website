title: "Why are there sometimes only 3 available courts to play on?"
---

The RSF workers are the ones that set up the badminton nets. Depending on the RSF gym schedule, occasionally badminton is only scheduled to have 3 courts for certain times. Because so few people usually show up at the very beginning of open gym, the RSF workers only set up 3 courts until more people show up and leave the other half for basketball. If there are only 3 courts set up and people are waiting for courts, go down to the front desk (just inside the main entrance) and ask to check the schedule. If badminton is supposed to have both sides of the gym, ask them to set up the other side.
