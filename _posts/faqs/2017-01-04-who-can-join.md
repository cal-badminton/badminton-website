Cal Badminton is open to anyone in the Berkeley community. We have members who are undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, local residents, and even international visitors. While there are certain restrictions on who can play in intercollegiate meets, EVERYONE has access to club practices, tournaments and socials. <strong>You do not need to be good to join.</strong> There is time on Saturdays for drilling and practicing and we would be happy to help you.
