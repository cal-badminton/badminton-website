title: "What does 'club only' mean?"
---

The Fieldhouse is open on Saturdays from 10am to 1pm for "club only" practice. This is the time when ladder matches and drilling happens for the club. We almost never take up the full 6 courts, so others are welcome to use any free courts. But this is also the time that intercollegiate meets takes place, so the club reserves the right to remove non-club members if it needs the court space.
