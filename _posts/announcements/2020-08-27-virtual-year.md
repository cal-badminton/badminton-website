Welcome to a new school year and say hello to our [new officers](/meet-officers.html)! The team will be doing their best to make the most of the current virtual semester and continue running club operations for the 2020-2021 school year. Since online learning greatly restricts the range of club activities that are possible, there will be no club dues for now. However, don't forget to check out [Cal Badminton @Calapalooza](/images/flyer_2020.jpg) and hang out with some cool people! Also, be sure to stay tuned for future announcements regarding the status of club activities as we (hopefully) exit the era of COVID-19!
