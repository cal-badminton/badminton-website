Welcome to a new school year and say hello to our [new officers](./meet-officers.html)! These dedicated, talented people will keep the club up and running for the 2021-2022 school year. However, don't forget to check out [Cal Badminton @Calapalooza](./images/flyer_fall_2021.jpg) and hang out with some cool people! Be sure to stay tuned for future announcements regarding the status of open gym and other club activities as we (hopefully) exit the era of COVID-19!
