Welcome to a new school year and say hello to our [new officers](/meet-officers.html)! These dedicated, talented people will keep the club up and running for the 2021-2022 school year. Feel free to checkout Cal Badminton's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/calbadminton1/), join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/calbadminton) and lastly come hangout with some cool people at [Caltopia](/images/flyer_fall_2021.jpg)! Be sure to stay tuned for future announcements regarding the status of open gym and other club activities as we (hopefully) exit the era of COVID-19!
