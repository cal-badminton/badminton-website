Wondering where and when to play? Our open gym, open to all skill levels, is normally held in the Recreational Sports Facility [Fieldhouse](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Recreational+Sports+Facility/@37.8685524,-122.265003,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80857c27cc9713eb:0x13657f86e249d525!8m2!3d37.8685524!4d-122.2628143?shorturl=1) at times located [here](https://recsports.berkeley.edu/badminton/). We also offer training sessions for any level on Saturdays 10am-1pm at the same location, with the courts open for play after from 1pm-11pm. Come through for some great badminton and great people!
